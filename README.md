# SuperResolutionGANs

This is an academic purpose repository containing resources related to Generative Adversarial Networks used in the context of Super Resolution. <br>
Super-Resolution AI tasks are crucial in today's technology landscape because they enhance visual quality, improve user experiences, optimize bandwidth and storage, aid in medical imaging, and find applications in video surveillance, art restoration, and more.

#Repo structure
In this repo you will find:
* SRGAN: this directory contains an implementation from scratch of the SRGAN model as seen in [Christian Ledig et al. 2016. Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network. [* https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)]. This is an academyc pourpose project.
